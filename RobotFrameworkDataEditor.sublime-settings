        Defines a root folder where Robot Framework Data Editor starts looking
        for Robot Framework data. Before the Robot Framework Data Editor
        can provide the keyword and variable completion features, it needs
        to scan and index the test suite and resource files. The argument
        defines the root folder where scanning of robot data is performed.

        In windows the backslash is the folder separator and in json
        backslash is the escape character. Therefore, in windows write
        double backslash to write literal backslash.

        Module search path defines a list of paths where the where the

        a library with the library name, then module search path must
        contain the folder where the library can be located.

        The Robot Framework Data Editor uses the Robot Framework API to parse
        the test data and libraries. All changes, which are not system
        wide, to locate the libraries, must also be added in the
        module search path in the Robot Framework Data Editor

        More details how libraries is searched in Robot Framework can be
        found from be the Robot Framework User guide:
